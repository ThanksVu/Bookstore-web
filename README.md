### ✅ Notes:
- You can update the `Team Members` section with real names or GitHub profiles.
- Replace links and filenames as needed to match your actual project.
- If you're deploying this publicly, remember **not to push sensitive files like `.env` or `config.php` with real passwords.**

Let me know if you'd like the `README.md` content in **Vietnamese** or want a version tailored for a framework (like Laravel).
